## Flavours

Routinely in our lives, we try and decide what we want to live for. Ever since humans reached a high level of comfort and survivability through easy access to calories and technological innovation (read: anything more sophisticated than wattle-and-daub housing), the question of 'what are we here for' has attracted much targeted thought. It appears that as soon as the survival imperative is taken care of, the mind thirsts for a purpose other than eating, drinking, sleeping and fucking.

It follows that whether we're killed by wildebeast or whether we succumb to dehydration is no longer a valid question. If our survival is taken care of, how do we assess our success on this Earth? 





As the inner life becomes more complex, so should the goal of living. A simple monologue of "find food, find shelter, reproduce" is replaced by whatever we decide to focus our intentions on. In other words, the question becomes introspective. 





Periodic self-assessment is a way of keeping it real, and making sure our current cirumstances aren't too out of step with what we think we should be doing.

This self-assessment may not always produce the results that you hope for. You might realise that your occupation doesn't line up with what you expected, or that your moral compass, your conviction, has shifted in a way that would make 'old you' a tad salty. 

This is a fruitful activity.  [my website](http://www.isaacschultz.com).
