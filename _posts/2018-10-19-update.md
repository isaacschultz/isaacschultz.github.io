## Flavours

Routinely in our lives, we try and decide what we want to live for. Ever since humans reached a high level of comfort and survivability through easy access to calories and technological innovation (read: anything more sophisticated than wattle-and-daub housing), the question of 'what are we here for' has attracted much targeted thought. It appears that as soon as the survival imperative is taken care of, the mind thirsts for a purpose other than eating, drinking, sleeping and fucking.

It follows that whether we're killed by wildebeast or whether we succumb to dehydration is no longer a valid question. If our survival is taken care of, how do we assess our success on this Earth? 

As the inner life becomes more complex, so should the goal of living. A simple monologue of "find food, find shelter, reproduce" is replaced by whatever we decide to focus our intentions on. In other words, the question becomes introspective. 

One form this introspection takes is periodic self-assessment, which is a way of keeping it real and making sure our current cirumstances aren't too out of step with what we think we should be doing.

This may not always produce the results that we hope for. We might realise that out occupation doesn't line up with what we expected, or that our moral compass, our conviction, has shifted in a way that would make 'old you' a tad salty. 

Realising this is a valuable chanc eto objectively re-evaluate. Is our time on earth well-spent? Is it represented in a way that would make us 'proud', objectively, from today's standpoint?

Often, the idea of what makes us 'proud' is hindered by preconceptions we have held in the past that carry forward as memories and miniature thought processes to form our present-day mode of thinking. However, what really matters is what notions we form when we perform an objective re-evaluation of what we think our current circumstances mean to us.
