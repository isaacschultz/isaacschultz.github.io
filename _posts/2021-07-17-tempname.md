### How do people get their news these days?

I would really like to know.  Every major media outlet seems to publish the same things. I just want to learn about things that aren't already embedded in the public consciousness. 

I have just stumbled upon:
[Lapham's Quarterly](https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/)

Appears to be of high quality with interesting subjects.


[The Kenyon Review](https://kenyonreview.org/)

A lot of the writing on The Kenyon Review seems overly adulterated. I read a poem which was okay but bleak; a short story that was a bit self-serving, 


[Foxed Quarterly](https://foxedquarterly.com/)

[Hedgehog Review](https://hedgehogreview.com/)

[Salvage](https://salvage.zone/)

[Arts and Letters Daily](https://aldaily.com/)

[The Public Domain Review](https://publicdomainreview.org/)


I went for a walk today. It wasn't an angry walk, but it was a determined walk. I was walking as though I had to expel something from my consciousness, and the only way to do so was by planting my feet wide and moving fast, and getting a little bit annoyed by the peopel walking in front of me.

I usually see a few different archetypes of people out on walks.

Archetype 1: Slow Young Families
Fairly self-explanatory. Sometimes there's a lightly-bearded 30-something father with a baby carrier, and always there is a woman in a brigh top with her hair tied back and a pair of yoga pants on.

Archetype 2: The Elderly Couple
"They probably own half the suburb" - or that's what I think when I see them. I kind of resent these people because I get the impression that they've had it easy. 

Archetype 3: The Runner
Like me but with a functioning left ankle (at least).


### I thought this picture was kind of cool. It's a defective tissue box.
It still serves its purpose, but it is still defective by definition. Kind of a broad category to be put in.
